# Psychological Safety

## Questions

* What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
  * Members having roughly the same amount of time speaking or "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking."
  * Having a high "average social sensitivity"
  * Interpersonal trust
  * Mutual respect
* Evaluate, with details, a previous setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
  * Currently I'm on a team of two other people where we just work quite well together playing to each other's strengths.  We've also had a few moments outside of work where they were able to open up a bit (or let loose) on some things in their past that either have had lasting trauma or certain paths or life choices that they have taken and how it made them the people they are today.
* What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
  * Overall they tend to be more productive and have a higher collective group IQ

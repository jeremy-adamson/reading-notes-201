# Transforms and Animations

## CSS Transforms

* What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?
  * It allows the developer to do static geometric tranformations (probably done with a transform matrix).
* Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.
  * I would probably incorporate some amount of tilting for a little flare or play around with the perspective attribute for a Star Wars/Space Balls-ish intro look.

## CSS Transitions and Animations

* What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
  * A transition tag indicates how a change should happen, typically in terms of the amount of time and how that time flows (ie linear, ease-in-out)
* How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?
  * Transitions are limited to only moving from one state directly to one other state, although multiple attributes can be paired up with this change of state.
  * Animations are typically used when there are multiple waypoints along the way from the start state to the end state

## Simple transitions that will wow users

* What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?
  * With CSS3 it really doesn't take that much effort (maybe a few lines) to incorporate transitions.
* How does this topic fit in with your long-term goals?
  * For some of the projects that I'm working on (and future ones), incorporation of transitions will give my pages a bit more of a polished look instead of blocky on/off changes of state/hover

# Images, Color, Text

## HTML

* What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?
  * For providing alternative text for when an image won't load. Also works for screen readers.
* How can you improve accessibilty of images in an HTML document?
  * By including relevent `alt` information and attaching `figcaption` to the figure.
* Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.
  * `figure` can be used to combine `figcaption` tags to a particular piece of media
* Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
  * I'm not sure but a `svg` is vector based and the rest of the information on `svg` seems to conflict with each other
* What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
  * PNG, there is less loss of resolution with the format.

## CSS

* Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
  * Color is the color of the words while background color is the color of the paper the words are printed on
* Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
  * Probably some additons of background color overall and a few font color variations outlined in a CSS file assuming multiple element tags are used in the site
* What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
  * If a font is readily available or if that particular font family is readily available
* What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?
  * `font-size` determines how large each letter is
  * `font-weight` often indicates if letters are bold or not
  * `font-style` often indicates if italics (or a variant of) are being used
* Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element.
  * `letter-spacing` and `word-spacing` which pretty much indicate the pixel padding around each character or word respectively

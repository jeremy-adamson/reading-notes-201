## CSS - Flexbox

* Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what that means.
  * It means that for each "box", items are primarily arranged side by side in either one row or column.
* Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
  * Main axis is the direction of flex flow (primary flow) while the cross axis is the remaining orthogonal direction.
* How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
  * The rearrangement of items apart from their HTML content can confuse screen readers into providing the wrong information for that particular section or "box".
* What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
  * Floats can be a bit difficult to wrangle sometimes for things like vertically centering a block of content inside a parent, resizing, and making content boxes all the same size
* How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
  * It certainly provides a much more useful tool to use in place of the previous methods.  The dilemma in the future would be to figure out the best time to use flexbox or the best time to use grid.

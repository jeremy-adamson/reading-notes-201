  * A parameter is the variable defined in the function declaration while an argument is whatever is being passed to the function when it is called or invoked.

## Misc

* Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
  * Learing from other students and being able to receive differing viewpoints exposes a person to different styles of coding which one person might not have thought of on their own.

# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## JavaScript Object Basics

* How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
  * An object is a collection of categories/properties of a thing all bundled up into one package
* What are some advantages to creating object literals?
  * Object literals contain all the information in one package and the packets can be referenced directly by name instead of an index (such as arrays).
* How do objects differ from arrays?
  * The properties of an object can be directly referenced by name instead of by index.
* Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access and object's property instead of dot notation.
  * If the name/property is a variable itself.  Also only bracket notation can be used to access properties with uncommon names, such as those with spaces.
* Evaluate the code below. What does the term `this` refer to and what is the advantage to using `this`?
  * `this` refers to the current object and advantages of 'this' come into play with constructors.

## Introduction to the DOM

* What is the DOM?
  * Document Object Model.  Basically treating the webpage itself as an object that can be manipulated.
* Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript
  * The DOM provides a structure that JavaScript can interact with.

# Debugging

## Topics

* Name some key differences between a syntax error and a logic error
  * Typically a syntax error won't compile or run due to a rule violation or a typo.  Most code will run if it has a logical error, but there will be unintended consequences and it'll be difficult to track down.
* List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
  * Debugging is just a part of software development and I've grown quite accustomed to tracking down errors.  Typically console.logs, alerts, break points, are my main tools to help isolate the start and stop points of possible errors.
* How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals
  * Well... I strive to try and break code as much as possible through logic errors when it comes to testing since too many times people will walk away if it compiles and runs.  It's a useful tactic that I'll continues to use in the future when it comes to writing testing software.
* How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
  * The JavaScript debugger tool can show what is going on under the hood, if there are any errors, and what variables are being stored/passed.
* Define what a breakpoint is.
  * An artificial point in the code that can be inserted to stop the program from running once it reaches that point
* What is the call stack?
  * An abstract structure of the order in which nested functions have been called and the order in which functions are resolved.
